Final Project Concept: 

Develop a personalizable packing app that provides recommendations based on you and your trip details – destination, duration, and types of activities.

User Stories:

As a user, I want to be able to create an account, so I don’t have to keep inputing personal details.

As a user, I want to be able to input the destination, duration, and type of trip, so that I can get personalized recommendations based on those details.

As a user, I want to be able to see the weather of my destination in the app, so that I don’t have to check it separately.

As a user, I want to have multiple packing list templates for various types of trips (beach vacation, skiing trip, work trip, etc.), so I can more easily generate my customized packing list.

As a user, I want to be able to develop my own templates, so that I don’t have to keep recreating specific packing lists.

As a user, I want to receive recommendations on what to bring based on the weather and temperature (e.g. umbrella, light jacket, heavy jacket, etc.), so that I can more easily create the right packing list.

As a user, I want to receive recommendations on the number of items of something to bring (e.g. underwear).

As a user, I want to be able to be “friends” with other users, so that we can plan a trip together.

As a user, I want to be able to share my packing list with my “friends,” so that we can collaborate on packing lists.
